Jeff Tunnell of Garage Games has launched a new blog site call Make It Big In Games.

Quote from Jeff Tunnell:
"Six years ago when we started GarageGames I didn't truly know if 'indies' could succeed in making a living making games without large publisher support. In fact, unaffiliated game developers were not even called indies back then..."

He further explains that he will explore strategies for indie game developers' success and plans to develop a companion wiki for the blog.

Good luck Jeff! [Link](http://makeitbigingames.com/)
