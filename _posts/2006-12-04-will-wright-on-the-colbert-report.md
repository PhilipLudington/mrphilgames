Will Wright appeared on the Colbert Report last night. A kind netizen has posted the segment on Google Video. Mr. Wright does a great job and even managed to gets Colbert laughing a little. I've seen Mr. Wright speak twice in person and it is always a treat, this format is no different. My favorite part is when the start talking Spore as a God sim.
