![Iron Roads Game]({{ "/assets/images/iron-roads-final.jpg" | relative_url }})

The holidays have kept me so busy I haven't talked any about my new project. Another [Ludum Dare 48 Hour](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/about-ludum-dare/) game development contest occurred the weekend of December 5th. It was my fourth time to play and the 13th contest to date.

This time the theme was "Roads." Roads turned out to be a very difficult theme. I brainstormed all night Friday before bed (the contests started at 11 pm my time) and then again in the morning for a total of two to three hours. I couldn't come up with anything I liked and also seemed simple enough to finish in the 48 hour time limit.

So I went with the idea I liked the most, a Railroad Tycoon type business simulator. I confidently and correctly judge I would not finish it in time, but I've got a wonderful start on a game I'm really excited about. I call it Iron Roads.

You can read the few and short posts I made during the contest on the Ludum Dare website: [MrPhil's Iron Roads](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/?category_name=ld13&author_name=mrphil).
