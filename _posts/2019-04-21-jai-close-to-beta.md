Last night, [Abner announced on his Twitch stream that Jai is close to beta release](https://www.twitch.tv/abnercoimbre). He showed a list of items that Jon Blow and the Jai Team have agreed need to be completed and then they will release the beta. No date or timeline was specified but based on the visible todo list, it is my opinion, this will happen before the end of the year.

I'm pretty excited for this to happen. I think I'll enjoy programming in the language and believe it will be very productive to use. Not to mention all the useful game-related libraries the Jai Team has built.
