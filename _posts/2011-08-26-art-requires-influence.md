These are some thought provoking videos about the origin of art and creativity. I recommend you watch them:

- [Everything is a Remix Part 1](http://vimeo.com/14912890)
- [Everything is a Remix Part 2](http://vimeo.com/19447662)
- [Everything is a Remix Part 3](http://vimeo.com/25380454)

It is hard to argue against the point that in order to create you must understand what has already been done and then put your mark on it. Maybe I should make some "copy" games in the same way that Hunter S. Thomas retyped the Great Gatsby.
