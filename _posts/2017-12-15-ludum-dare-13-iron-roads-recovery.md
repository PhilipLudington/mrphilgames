**Theme:** "Roads" (December 2008)

I recently recovered an old game project from Ludum Dare 13, which took place back in December 2008! While the entry was incomplete at the time, it received some great comments and encouragement from reviewers.

## Project Recovery

After digging through old files, I managed to recover the code and have made it available for preservation:

- **Source Code:** [GitHub Repository]({{ page.github_link }})
- **Playable Game:** [Iron Roads on itch.io]({{ page.itch_link }})

The original Ludum Dare submission can still be viewed on the legacy Ludum Dare site.

## Historical Context

This represents one of my earlier game jam entries from nearly a decade ago. Even though it wasn't completed during the jam period, the positive feedback from the community was encouraging and helped motivate continued game development.
