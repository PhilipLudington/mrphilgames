Big Fish Games has banned "Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble" from their service. Despite having a Teen rating from TIGRS, the game was removed due to "adult scenes" that offended some customers.

This is concerning for the future of creative freedom in game development. Don't let the message be that developers need to "dumb down" their stories.

I encourage everyone to support independent game developers like Mousechief who are willing to push creative boundaries and tell meaningful stories through interactive media.
