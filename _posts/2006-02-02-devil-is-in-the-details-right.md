I recently got my hands on **Game Architecture and Design**. So far I've been impressed with it and I'm going to try and follow it chapter by chapter and apply it to my game Alien Sovereign. I've been working on a document for a couple years now catching all my ideas and refining things, which is a cross between the Treatment that the book describes in Chapter 2 and a first pass at the Game Spec described in chapter 2. It is causing me problems in structure department, oh well.

I think, I hope, this book has kicked it into my head that I'm really lacking on the details for my game. I've come across the idea in other books, but until now I keep thinking that somehow I'd work out the details while I was coding. Instead it has been a big barrier to coding because I get lost as to what to do next, which leads to procrastination via tinkering with new technology and the like.

I've also been playing with the new Alpha 4 release of T2D and some of the new tutorials up on TDN.
