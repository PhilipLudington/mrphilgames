**Theme:** Escape

For Ludum Dare 21, I worked on a game inspired by Pac-Man mechanics but focused on the escape theme.

## Development Process

I initially started with Unity3D but ended up switching to XNA during development. The game incorporated Pac-Man-inspired mechanics while focusing on the core theme of escape, creating an interesting blend of classic arcade gameplay with the jam's requirements.

**Initial Engine:** Unity3D  
**Final Engine:** XNA  
**Inspiration:** Pac-Man mechanics
