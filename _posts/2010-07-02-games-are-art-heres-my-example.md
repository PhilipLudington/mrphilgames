Roger Ebert has [softened his stance](http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/07/okay_kids_play_on_my_lawn.html) on video games as art. While he isn't convinced that some game, somewhere might be art, he at least leaves that it is possible, maybe.

Here's my definitive example of a game that qualifies as art: [Every Day The Same Dream](http://armorgames.com/play/6244/every-day-the-same-dream).

This game demonstrates that interactive media can achieve the same emotional depth and artistic expression as traditional art forms.
