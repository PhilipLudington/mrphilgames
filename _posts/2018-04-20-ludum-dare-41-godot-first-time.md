I'll be participating in Ludum Dare 41! Pretty excited to use Godot for the first time!

This will be my first experience with the Godot game engine, which should be an interesting challenge. I might make some posts over on ldjam.com with my Ludum Dare 41 DevLogs to document the process of learning a new engine during the jam.

**Engine:** Godot (first time)  
**Event:** Ludum Dare 41
