I've decided to be more open about my game development process. I am creating a 4X strategy game, and I want to share my journey with you.

I have a deep love for strategy games and science fiction. Some of my favorite games include Star Craft, Civilization, and Homeworld. My favorite sci-fi movies include Star Wars, Blade Runner, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. As for books, I love Neuromancer and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

I have lots of ideas that I want to incorporate into the game, but most of all I want it to be fun to play for hours and hours and hours.

I'm intentionally keeping the game's specific title secret and avoiding committing to a release date - I want to avoid pressure while developing the game.

Feel free to email me with questions, ideas, and jokes at mrphil (at) mrphilgames.com.
