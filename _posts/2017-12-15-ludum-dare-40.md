**Theme:** "The more you have, the worse it is"

I participated in Ludum Dare 40 and created a Tower Defense game using Game Maker 2! The theme was "The more you have, the worse it is," which I thought fit perfectly with a Tower Defense concept.

## Game Concept

The game features a mage imprisoned in a maze built for criminals with magic abilities. Monsters patrol the halls, and you have the ability to cast spells that create Totems (towers) that shoot fireballs at the enemies.

I describe it as "basically a Roguelike mashed with Tower Defense" - an interesting hybrid concept that worked well for the jam theme.

## Development Experience

I had been learning Game Maker 2 by building a Tower Defense game, so when the theme was announced, I immediately knew what direction to take. Game Maker performed great during the jam, and it was one of my most productive game jams, though the tool did get on my nerves in a few places.

## Future Plans

The clear next step would be procedurally generated mazes, which would really lean into the Roguelike elements and provide more replay value.
