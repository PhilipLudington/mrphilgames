**Theme:** Tiny World

For Ludum Dare 23, I created "Seeds of Destruction" - a game about Seed warfare that fits the "Tiny World" theme.

The concept explores conflict at a microscopic level, where seeds engage in warfare within their tiny world environment. This was an interesting interpretation of the theme that allowed for creative gameplay mechanics around small-scale combat.
