I want to share my struggles with procrastination and finding motivation in game development, along with two key insights I've learned:

## The importance of "fun" in project selection

I realized that choosing projects and tools that aren't enjoyable leads to procrastination. Procrastination was becoming a huge problem... because my projects lacked any element of fun.

## Embracing "good enough" over perfection

As Voltaire said: "The Best is the enemy of The Good." This means stopping constant project churn and being satisfied with good solutions rather than always seeking the perfect approach.

After exploring various approaches (a Fantasy Football website, buying an existing game, using Torque engine), I've decided to:

- Return to C# programming
- Work on my "dream project"
- Focus on what's fun and motivating
- Keep my day job for financial stability

I'm now working on a science fiction strategy game. Feel free to email me with questions or ideas.
