I'm about half way through this weekend's [Ludum Dare 21](http://www.ludumdare.com) (although the traffic level is really bad right now.) The theme is _Escape_.

Tools used:
- [Unity3d 3.4](http://unity3d.com/)
- [Visual Studio 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio)
- [Paint](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/paint)

My Pac Man mechanic isn't exactly fun, but it's too late in the contest now to change. I'm using momentum or forces to move the player, which at least offers one interesting difference over the classic game. This makes moving around a little less straightforward and might have some emergent strategies.

Interesting! [Notch](http://notch.tumblr.com/) of [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/) fame is [video streaming live as he programs his Ludum Dare 21 entry](http://twitch.tv/realnotch)!!
