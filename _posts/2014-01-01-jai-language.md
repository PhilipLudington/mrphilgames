Jonathan Blow of Braid fame gave a really interesting Twitch/YouTube talks about making a new language to replace C/C++ that is specifically for making games with: [YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9VCN6UkyQ).

I'm very interested and his rationals resonates a lot with me. I gave up C/C++ long, long ago because it was so messy and convoluted. This could totally bring me back to a "bare metal" language.

I started a reference page to collect links, etc: [JAI Reference Page](http://www.mrphilgames.com/jai/)
